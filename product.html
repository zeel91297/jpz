        characteristics brought through different types of fabric weaves. One of these </br>
        weaves is the jacquard which produces jacquard fabric. It is a fabric woven on </br>
        a special loom called the jacquard loom. This loom allows individul control on</br>
        interlacing of up to several hundred warp threads that can give birth to innu-

<font size="6" color="white">Jacquard fabrics have complex patterns on them. These fabrics are made on the jacquard loom. Jacquard fabrics have floats and luster. They are more stable and stretchy than the fabrics made through basic weaves. Some of the examples of jacquard fabric include matelasse fabric, satin fabrics, brocade fabric, damask fabric etc. Jacquard fabrics are mainly used for upholstery and as drapery fabrics. </font>

<font size="6" color="white">Jacquard WeavingJacquard weaving uses all types of fibers and blends of fibers and is capable of creating complex patterns on fabrics. For making these complex patterns, the jacquard loom can be programmed to raise each warp thread independently of the others. In this way, jacquard weaving gives highest warp yarn control. In fact, the invention of Jacquard loom and jacquard weaving made possible the automatic production of innumerable varieties of pattern weaving.
